Welcome to my collection of Python mini–projects!
This repository contains small, structured coding challenges that cover core Python concepts such as loops, lists, dictionaries, sets, functions, and conditional logic.

Each project is designed to build problem-solving skills and simulate real-world scenarios in a simple way.
